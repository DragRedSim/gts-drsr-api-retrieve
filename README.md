# Deprecation Notice
This project is being archived, due to the impending shutdown of the online service for GT Sport.
Appropriate data was not exposed by the GT7 API to allow this to continue to function, modified or otherwise.
The code will stay available for reference, just don't expect it to actually work for anything.

# gts-drsr-api-retrieve
Calls the public GT Sport API to get the latest DR and SR values for a streaming overlay.

To get your user ID (needed to pull down information for the correct account):
* Go to https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gtsport/user/ and sign in
* Once signed in, click on the "My Profile" link
* The User ID is a number in the URL, between 'profiles/' and '/overview'.

Alternatively:
* Head to https://www.kudosprime.com/gts/stats.php?profile=search and enter your PSN ID.
* The number you need is the Profile ID near the bottom; alternatively, it's also the number at the end of the URL, after "?profile=".

Roadmap for future updates is in issues; feel free to add to it! The base version was hacked together in a few hours, more intended to be added Soon^TM.
