# gts-drsr-api-retrieve
Calls the public GT Sport API to get the latest DR and SR values for a streaming overlay.

To get your user ID (needed to pull down information for the correct account):
* Go to https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gtsport/user/ and sign in
* Once signed in, click on the "My Profile" link
* The User ID is a number in the URL, between 'profiles/' and '/overview'.

Alternatively:
* Head to https://www.kudosprime.com/gts/stats.php?profile=search and enter your PSN ID.
* The number you need is the Profile ID near the bottom; alternatively, it's also the number at the end of the URL, after "?profile=".

Roadmap for future updates is in issues; feel free to add to it! The base version was hacked together in a few hours, more intended to be added Soon^TM.
